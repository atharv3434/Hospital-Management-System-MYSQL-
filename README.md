Hospital Management System - Project Description
📜 Project Overview
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a comprehensive database solution built using MySQL that aims to streamline hospital operations. It efficiently manages patient records, doctor appointments, medical reports, pharmacy stock, billing, staff management, and room allocation. The system enhances data accuracy, reduces paperwork, and improves overall hospital workflow by integrating various hospital functionalities into a single database.

🎯 Real-World Problem Statement
Managing hospital records manually can lead to errors, inefficiencies, and delays in patient care. Challenges include:
✅ Inaccurate patient records due to human error.
✅ Difficulty tracking doctor availability and appointments.
✅ Lack of automation in billing and pharmacy management.
✅ Room allocation inefficiencies and overbooking issues.

Our HMS Database System solves these problems by automating processes, ensuring real-time updates, and optimizing hospital resource allocation.
